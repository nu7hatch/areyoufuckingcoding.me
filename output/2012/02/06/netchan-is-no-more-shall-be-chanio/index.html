            <p>Aaah, I just came back from a short backpacking trip to Argentina, refreshed
and full of energy! Yeap, it's a great time to write my first real blog post...</p>

<h3 id="Not+for+newbies...">Not for newbies...</h3>

<p>I have to clarify something first. You have to be aware that it's not gonna
be a blog for total newbies. You have to know at least basics of Go and you can
learn it by going through <a href="http://tour.golang.org/#1"><strong>Interactive Go Tour</strong></a>.
If you haven't seen it yet, <strong>go there</strong> and <strong>come back when you finish</strong>!</p>

<p><strong>Yes, you have to read it!</strong></p>

<h3 id="What's+up+with+NetChan?">What's up with NetChan?</h3>

<p>Current stable release of Go (r60) still has netchan in the standard packages, but
it has already been changed in the weekly release and netchan will be not included to Go 1.
What can we do instead then? Nothing!</p>

<p>There's no official package which provides network wrappers for the channels,
but <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/golang-nuts/browse_thread/thread/12bdd37ad9ed4a68?pli=1">this TLTR thread</a>
on <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/golang-nuts/">Go nuts mailing list</a> brought up a
few nice ideas. The one I liked the most is a wrapper which allows to bind the
channel with any kind of <a href="http://weekly.golang.org/pkg/io/#Reader"><code>io.Reader</code></a>
or <a href="http://weekly.golang.org/pkg/io/#Writer"><code>io.Writer</code></a>. It sounds like a fun
thing to do and great exercise to learn something, let's implement it then!</p>

<h3 id="Specification">Specification</h3>

<p>So, we want to have a package implementing the following features:</p>

<ul>
<li>it should allow to read data from an <code>io.Reader</code> by consuming from the channel</li>
<li>it should allow to write data to an <code>io.Writer</code> by publishing to the channel</li>
<li>it should be able to read and write any kind of Go values</li>
<li>it should be thread-safe</li>
</ul><h3 id="Any+kind+of+value?">Any kind of value?</h3>

<p>First two requirements seems to be very obvious, let's take a look at the third
one. As you should know, channel needs to have defined a type of the data which
can operate:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go"><span class="n">ch</span> <span class="p">:=</span> <span class="nb">make</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">chan</span> <span class="nb">int</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">ch</span> <span class="p">&lt;-</span> <span class="s">"hello"</span> <span class="c1">// wrong! type error during the compilation</span>
<span class="n">ch</span> <span class="p">&lt;-</span> <span class="mi">1</span>       <span class="c1">// ok</span></code></pre>

<p>Cool, so let's define a constructor which takes an <code>io.Reader</code>/<code>io.Writer</code> and
type of the data as a paramemeters... Yay!</p>

<div class="meme">
  <img src="/img/meme-nope-1.jpg" alt="NOPE!">
</div>


<p>Why not? Because it's simply impossible to use a type as a parameter/variable.
In Ruby, for example, you can do this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby"><span class="n">arr</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">Array</span>
<span class="n">hello</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">arr</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"hello"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"world"</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre>

<p>But this is not Ruby and you can't do it... Problem? Oh, do I hear rubyists
saying now <em>"naah, that language sucks!"</em>? :)</p>

<p>Ok, let's think about it for a second... Do we actually need to care about the
type at all? We could give users more freedom by working on interface channels.
Take a look:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go"><span class="n">ch</span> <span class="p">:=</span> <span class="nb">make</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">chan</span> <span class="k">interface</span><span class="p">{})</span>
<span class="n">ch</span> <span class="p">&lt;-</span> <span class="s">"hello"</span> <span class="c1">// ok</span>
<span class="n">ch</span> <span class="p">&lt;-</span> <span class="mi">1</span>       <span class="c1">// ok too!</span></code></pre>

<p>Quack quack! By the power of duck typing! So now things get simpler, we just
need to write a wrapper for the <code>chan interface{}</code>. Looks cool, but it has one
small disadvantage... it's not idiot-proof:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go"><span class="n">x</span> <span class="p">:=</span> <span class="p">&lt;-</span><span class="n">ch</span>
<span class="n">fmt</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Println</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">.(</span><span class="nb">string</span><span class="p">))</span></code></pre>

<p>The code above will compile, because it uses type assertion to get a string
value from the interface. But what do you think is going to happen when the
channel will receive a value of any other type, different than string...</p>

<div class="meme">
  <img src="/img/meme-panic-1.gif" alt="PANIC!">
</div>


<p>We can prevent that situation by checking if the type assertion was correct:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go"><span class="n">x</span> <span class="p">:=</span> <span class="p">&lt;-</span> <span class="n">ch</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">str</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">ok</span> <span class="p">:=</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">.(</span><span class="nb">string</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="n">ok</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="n">fmt</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Println</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">str</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="n">fmt</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Fprintf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">os</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Stderr</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"%v is not a string!"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre>

<p>I think that I don't need to explain how it works... you should remember it
from the Go Tutorial. Anyway, it's very important to <strong>check if assertion was
correct</strong> always when you are <strong>not sure</strong> about the type of the interface's value.</p>

<p>Regardless type assertions, this way looks good and simple enough to implement,
let's move forward then.</p>

<h3 id="Reading+and+Writing">Reading and Writing</h3>

<p>As I said, first two requirements seems to be clear and explicit. But now
we have to consider them to be compliant with the third one. So we need to
be able to write (serialize) any kind of the data into IO stream.</p>

<p>Go provides an awesome solution of this problem in its standard library.
There's a package called <a href="http://weekly.golang.org/pkg/encoding/gob/"><code>encoding/gob</code></a>,
which implements <strong>exchanging of binary encoded Go values</strong> between transmiter
(<code>io.Writer</code>) and receiver (<code>io.Reader</code>). This is it! Here's a trivial example of
how it works:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go"><span class="n">f</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">_</span> <span class="p">:=</span> <span class="n">os</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"~/wire.gob"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">en</span> <span class="p">:=</span> <span class="n">gob</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">NewEncoder</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">en</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Encode</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">en</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Encode</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"hello"</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="n">f</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Seek</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">os</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">SEEK_SET</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">de</span> <span class="p">:=</span> <span class="n">gob</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">NewDecoder</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">var</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="nb">int</span>
<span class="k">var</span> <span class="n">s</span> <span class="nb">string</span>
<span class="n">_</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">de</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Decode</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">// =&gt; 1</span>
<span class="n">_</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">de</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Decode</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">s</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">// =&gt; "hello"</span></code></pre>

<p><strong>Note!</strong> I'm leaving <code>"_"</code> (ignored value) declaration in single-value context
intentionaly, it's just to let you know that error shall be handled there.</p>

<p>Current gob implementation has a few limitations, for example to serialize/deserialize
some custom structure, first you need to <strong>register it</strong>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go"><span class="k">type</span> <span class="n">Cat</span> <span class="k">struct</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="n">Cuteness</span> <span class="nb">int</span> 
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="k">func</span> <span class="n">init</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="n">gob</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Register</span><span class="p">(&amp;</span><span class="n">Cat</span><span class="p">{})</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre>

<p>Chuck Testa already explained you that it's not possible to pass a type as a
parameter, so gob uses a neat trick to register new type. It gets an <strong>empty
pointer to the struct</strong> as a parameter. That allows it to identify the struct's
fields, functions, etc, and later, quickly and efficiently serialize/deserialize
values of that type.</p>

<p>Btw, you know what <code>init</code> function does... right? If not, get the fuck out and
go through that <a href="http://tour.golang.org/#1"><strong>Go Tour</strong></a>!</p>

<h3 id="Implementing+a+Writer">Implementing a Writer</h3>

<p>Let's write some real, working code now. Binding a channel with specified
<code>io.Writer</code> can be done in two ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>get a channel as a parameter</li>
<li>create new channel, bind it with a given writer and return it</li>
</ul><p>First approach seems reasonable and may give a lot of flexibility to the users,
but if we will look at it closer it may also allow them to <strong>fuck things up</strong>.
For example, user can read data from the same channel he specified as a binding
for the writer, which may cause <strong>data corruption</strong>.</p>

<p>To keep this implementation simple and clean, let's assume that users wont
allow be able to bind an IO with existing channel. We should also prevent users
from reading data from the returned channel. It can be done by returning the
directional (write-only) channel:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go"><span class="n">ch</span> <span class="p">:=</span> <span class="nb">make</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">chan</span><span class="p">&lt;-</span> <span class="k">interface</span><span class="p">{})</span></code></pre>

<p>Ups, we have a problem here... If we will create a write only channel, then we're
screwed, becase we can't read from it! But no worries, don't panic, everything's
gonna be alright! Go has a neat solution for that as well. We can use a bi-directional
channel as a directional one just by assignment:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go"><span class="k">var</span> <span class="n">wch</span> <span class="k">chan</span><span class="p">&lt;-</span> <span class="nb">string</span>   <span class="c1">// write-only channel</span>
<span class="k">var</span> <span class="n">rch</span> <span class="p">&lt;-</span><span class="k">chan</span> <span class="nb">string</span>   <span class="c1">// read-only channel</span>
<span class="n">ch</span> <span class="p">:=</span> <span class="nb">make</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">chan</span> <span class="nb">string</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">// bi-directional channel</span>
<span class="n">wch</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">rch</span> <span class="p">:=</span> <span class="n">ch</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">ch</span>
<span class="n">wch</span> <span class="p">&lt;-</span> <span class="s">"hello"</span>
<span class="n">fmt</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Println</span><span class="p">(&lt;-</span><span class="n">rch</span><span class="p">)</span>      <span class="c1">// =&gt; "hello"</span></code></pre>

<p>As you can see, we can assign the bi-directional channel to both directional ones,
which allows us to use a write-only channel to publish data, and a read-only channel
to consume it.</p>

<div class="meme">
  <img src="/img/meme-marvelous-1.jpg" alt="MARVELOUS!">
</div>


<p>Now we can use that ability and create an internal channel for reading under
the hood, exposing the write-only part to the user. This is how our writer
implementation may look like:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go"><span class="k">func</span> <span class="n">NewWriter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">w</span> <span class="n">io</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Writer</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">chan</span><span class="p">&lt;-</span> <span class="k">interface</span><span class="p">{}</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="n">ch</span> <span class="p">:=</span> <span class="nb">make</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">chan</span> <span class="k">interface</span><span class="p">{})</span>
        <span class="k">go</span> <span class="n">write</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">w</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">ch</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">// spawning the worker function into another goroutine</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">ch</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="k">func</span> <span class="n">write</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">w</span> <span class="n">io</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Writer</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">ch</span> <span class="k">chan</span> <span class="k">interface</span><span class="p">{})</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="n">enc</span> <span class="p">:=</span> <span class="n">gob</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">NewEncoder</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">w</span><span class="p">)</span>

        <span class="p">}</span>
        <span class="c1">// ...</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre>

<p>Yeap, that's it. Trivial, isn't it? I don't know if I need to explain aything,
you should understand this code easily. From the same reason I'm not going to
describe the reader's implementation here. You can find a fully working, tested
and goinstallable package <a href="http://github.com/nu7hatch/gochanio">here</a>. Feel free
to fork it and play with it.</p>

<h3 id="Be+or+not+to+be+(in+standard+packages)">Be or not to be (in standard packages)</h3>

<p>Looking at the snippet above now, I have to admit that @kevlar_work was absolutelly
right during our IRC conversation - <strong>it's extremely easy to exchange data via
channels over the network</strong>. So now I'm sure there's no need to have such a generic
solution in the standard library.</p>

<p>But there's one more thing I can't stop thinking about. During our conversation
about chanio on go-nuts mailing list, Kyle Lemons came across the huge problem
of sharing channels over the network. By sharing channels I mean sending channels
via network channels and converting them into network channels...</p>

<div class="meme">
  <img src="/img/meme-inception-1.jpg">
</div>


<p>Yeah, sounds ridiculous, but the idea is actually really nice. Imagine that you can
share a structure containing internal channel over the network chan. If the
network channel (or serializer) were able to figure out how to convert that
internal chan into chanio on the fly it would be awesome! Right!? Right?...</p>

<p>Actually... <strong>no</strong>! The <a href="http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ch01s07.html"><strong>K.I.S.S. principle</strong></a>,
you remember that? Besides keeping it simple, we have to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development"><strong>lean</strong></a>,
and think about possible <em>clients/users</em> and their use cases (<em>Eliminate waste</em>).
If you start thinking about real life use cases you'll figure it out quickly that
all of them can be solved easier, more efficient and reliable with some dedicated
solutions. There's a humongous number of possible configurations, consistency and verbosity
levels, efficiency requirements, etc. For example, to share important financial data
requiring maximal consistency I would choose something like <a href="http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:7">Majordomo</a>.
In the other hand, real time weather notifications can be fault tolerant so we
can skip the whole heartbeat mechanism and just don't give a shit when messages are
lost. <strong>Using right tool to solve concrete problem</strong>, that's the important thing...</p>

<h3 id="Summary">Summary</h3>

<p>Ok, that's all folks in this first real post in this blog. Here's what you should remember
from this lesson:</p>

<ul>
<li>Always check if type assertion was correct if you're not sure about the type of
the interface's value.</li>
<li>You can expose bi-directional channels easily to read/write-only ones just by
assignment.</li>
<li>The gob package is a great tool to serialize and exchange Go values between
instances - of course remember about registering custom structures.</li>
<li>Eliminate waste - first rule of <em>Lean Software Development</em>, first validate if
there's real need for your feature.</li>
<li>And obviously... Keep It Simple, Stupid!</li>
</ul><p>Hope you enjoyed this article, comments are just down here, <strong>don't be shy</strong>! I'm
very curious about your feedback :).</p>
