            <p>It's been over a year since I joined <a href="http://cuboxlabs.com/">Cubox</a>. In the last
few days, visiting my motherland and participating in the amazing
<a href="http://wrocloverb.com">wroc_love.rb conference</a> led me to several reflections.
The fun is that all my technical and non-technical reflections
started joining together and clarifying my hacker's mindset.</p>

<p>These reflections were also heaviliy inspired by many people, i.a. drunk
<a href="http://twitter.com/apotonick">apotonick</a> repeating all the time that
<strong>Nothing really matters</strong> :). Let me tell you how true this sentence is
in the case of your business, code and even life.</p>

<h3 id="To+hack+or+not+to+hack?">To hack or not to hack?</h3>

<p>I joined Cubox as a hacker, geek and crazy optimization monster, doing
a lot of cool stuff, tweaking things up, learning and enjoying the code.
This blog post will be a retrospection of all the things I screwed up and
the cool things I figured out during 2011. All the things about
designing applications, about building them, about choosing right tools...
and about the business behind all of this. It will be about my metamorphosis
from a typical optimization monster into devoted K.I.S.S. evangelist and
lean approach enthusiast. It will also show you how I understand Lean
Startup and how do I think lean code should look like.</p>

<h3 id="Integration+vs.+acceptance+testing">Integration vs. acceptance testing</h3>

<p>The first idea I was working on at the new job was a way to speed up slow Selenium
tests. I was figuring out many weird things, from improving speed of ExtJS,
through faster ruby driver for V8 engine and at the headless browser
C++ library ending. Woah, that was a total failure. It was like this...</p>

<blockquote>
Yeah, there's V8 engine and it's awesome, and there's therubyracer
but is very slow so let's speed it up, oh but if we use ExtJS it still
sucks, I can write everything in C...
</blockquote>


<p>But meanwhile I realized something way more important: instead of speeding up
the tool (a very complicated tool) we should speed our tests up. Besides
<strong>the idea of running integration tests is to test if all the parts of
a system are composed into one integral application in the production
environment</strong>. There's no point to test the app in some virtual environment
which just simulates (poorly) all the others, widely used</p>

<p>Also, I started listening to many people around, and they all said
laudly and with confidence:</p>

<blockquote>
It's Cucumber fault that our tests are slow! Cucumber is too slow!
</blockquote>


<p>Or others, including me:</p>

<blockquote>
It's Rails fault! It's too slow at boot so our tests are slow!
</blockquote>


<p>And we started using some pure RSpec tests based on Capybara, figuring out
how to optimize Rails etc. But it was the same... Capybara, Cucumber, RSpec
and Rails are only tools. They don't matter, it's <strong>only a delivery method</strong>
for some part of our logic. <strong>The logic which supposted to be tested</strong>.</p>

<p>A few days ago, I had a horrible hangover, drinking some <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/nu7hatch/status/179605961886015488">mate</a>
with <a href="http://twitter.com/DrummerHead">DrummerHead</a> and reading again
<a href="http://twitter.com/godfoca">godfoca's</a> internal mail about the bussiness
value of splitting stories up into tasks (maybe he will publish it, worth
reading), juggling with some DCI papers around and listening to
<a href="http://confreaks.com/videos/759-rubymidwest2011-keynote-architecture-the-lost-years">Uncle Bob Martin's talk at Ruby Midwest</a>.</p>

<p>Then I figured something out... Well I didn't really, I just realized
something. I think that the user stories heavily and laudly promoted by BDD
and Cucumber are simply describing the wrong things. Let me put it this way:
they test things that don't matter at all for your business. Take a look
at the story:</p>

<pre><code>As a bar client
In order to drink a beer
I want to go to the bar
Order a beer
And when I pay for it with cash
I want to see my beer on the table
</code></pre>

<p>Hey, guys, no offense... but that sounds retarded. Besides, that's just
GUI testing! Some people may want to pay for the beer with a credit card, or open
a check and pay everything at the end. Others may want to order a beer from
the table without going to the bar. That kind of story doesn't test
your business requiremenets, they don't apply to your domain logic! Your
<code>Client</code> domains should be:</p>

<pre><code>- Drink a beer
- Be able to pay with cash or by card
- Be able to open check and pay at the end
</code></pre>

<p>You may notice that I don't mention the <code>bar</code> at all, because that's only
our <strong>delivery method</strong>, that's only a framework which may change in the
future. Going to the <code>bar</code> is not <code>client</code> domain here. We may change <code>bar</code>
into <code>delivery service</code> or <code>cute blonde waitress</code> and his domain
doesn't chage. He will be able to drink beer and pay for it however
he wants. <strong>Acceptance tests are supposed to test domain logic, not
the delivery method</strong>. The delivery method is only a tool, a plugin which
may be replaced at any time, without affecting your business model.
Delivery methods should be tested by an <strong>integration tool</strong> and be part
of the <strong>continuous integration process</strong> only!</p>

<p>Uncle Bob said something great, something I did repeat many times myself
but that some laud Rubyists around had different oppinions on:</p>

<blockquote>
The suite of tests is not there to satisfy the QA groups, it
is not there to prove to other people that our code works. The suite 
of tests is there so that we can refactor. So that when we bring the 
code up to our screen then we're not afraid of it.
</blockquote>


<p>Think about it guys...</p>

<h3 id="More+and+more+hammers">More and more hammers</h3>

<p>The second thing I recently realized was how pathological the application
design process is. Most of the projects we star from scratch start in a
pointless discussion of which framework is better, what database
should we use, what templating system should we apply, etc. <strong>We are
discussing about unimportant crap</strong>!</p>

<blockquote>
- I bet we are gonna have a lot of writes, let's use Cassandra! <br>
- Bullshit, there will be lot of reads too, Redis is best for that! <br>
- Fuck you! Let's do something simple first and then optimize,
  we should start with MySQL! <br>
- I don't want to live on this planet anymore... <br>
</blockquote>


<p>Maybe I am exaggerating, but there's a lot of bootstrap conversations
that look like this. But you know what? <strong>nothing really matters</strong>...
Those who have seen Uncle Bob's talk at Ruby Midwest should already
know that databases and frameworks are <strong>only tools</strong>, all this stuff,
all the hammers are <strong>only plugins</strong> and should be treated so.</p>

<h3 id="Lean+hacking?">Lean hacking?</h3>

<p>Thus, databases and frameworks are only delivery methods, we
don't know at the beginning of a project which one to use anyway. To be lean you
have to deliver a minimum viable domain model to your users and learn
from how they react. <strong>The way how you deliver your domain logic
is not important at all</strong>.</p>

<p>The book "The Lean Startup"  has become extremally popular recently. It has
been especially adopted by all the Rails developers and dev shops.</p>

<blockquote>
Yeah, we're fantastic because we can build a Rails app in 2 weeks
and validate your idea!
</blockquote>


<p>But again, Rails is only a tool, Rails doesn't determine the process
of the lean product building. No tool does it! The <strong>Lean approach
is this one which allows you to validate your domain model quickly by
measuring reactions of the users of your product</strong>. A minimum viable
product. If you make the validation of your domain logic (your idea) depend
on the tool, on the framework or on the database then you're not lean,
you are lost in dependencies' and tools' hell every time when you
want to change something. You are not lean, just an Agile Rails Development
shop or any other framework hyper! <strong>Lean is about eliminating any kind
of waste</strong>. Oh, what's that? Aren't all the dependencies, plugins
and tools which affect your domain model a waste?</p>

<h3 id="Clients+from+hell...">Clients from hell...</h3>

<p>Yeah, but we have to do the clients work, we have to deliver things,
we have to match their expectations, right? You know what... now
with humongous confidence I can say NO! Clients have ideas, and want
to realize them to check if they're ok. <strong>But clients want the designing of
the app to be the validation of their idea</strong> as well. Most
developers used to say:</p>

<blockquote>
Oh, that client wants to do some shitty reports there. We know that's
shit but they want to have it, let's do it then...
</blockquote>


<p>But that's wrong! <strong>Lean consultants should help the client to find
the best way to validate his product and eliminate waste</strong>. If you
think that something your client wants is a piece of crap and nobody is
going to use it <strong>say it</strong>. Insist to measure user needs. Doing
all the features required by the client super fast doesn't equal
being lean. <strong>Being lean means that you are a logical filter for all
the client's bad ideas</strong> - this is the very first validation of his
product.</p>

<p>The second problem with the clients is that they used to come with something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
We have an idea for a <strong>Rails application</strong>.
</blockquote>


<p>No motherfucker! You don't want to build a Rails app, what you want to
build is <strong>an application</strong>. It may become a Rails app, it may become a
Sinatra app, it may be even a console app, it doesn't matter. As I said
before that it is only a delivery method, and from the lean perspective
it's nothing else than <strong>waste</strong>. Mocks are friends of lean approach,
<strong>mock everything you can, that's the fastest way to see if your potential
users are going to like it or not</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="(C)lean+code...">(C)lean code...</h3>

<p>You know what, let's drink some beer now. But let's do it in a
different way. We are going to do it with Ruby today, sorry to all the Gophers
reading this article. I'll make some special episode about DDD in Go next
time. We're going to start writing the story and tests - that's how
TDD, BDD and other *DD variations works. <strong>You have to write tests first</strong>,
otherwise you are just waisting time (eliminate waste, remember?).</p>

<pre><code class="language-gherkin"><span class="k">Feature:</span><span class="nf"> Drinking beer</span>

<span class="nf">  </span><span class="k">Scenario:</span><span class="nf"> Drink a beer</span>

<span class="nf">    </span><span class="k">Then </span><span class="nf">I want to drink the beer I choose</span></code></pre>

<p>Let's say we want to have a beer drinking service:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby"><span class="no">When</span><span class="sr"> /I pick a beer/</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="vi">@drinking</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">BeerDrinkingService</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="no">Then</span><span class="sr"> /I want to drink the beer I choose/</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="vi">@drinking</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">call</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">should</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">"Pssst! Gulp, gulp, gulp... aaaah!"</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre>

<p>Now we know exactly what we want to do, we need a beer:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Beer</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">drink</span>
    <span class="s2">"Pssst! Gulp, gulp, gulp... aaaah!"</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre>

<p>... and some client who wants to drink it:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Client</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">drink_a_beer</span>
    <span class="no">Beer</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">drink</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre>

<p>Finally, we have to provide some way for the client o drink the beer
easily, we need some <strong>interaction</strong>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">BeerDrinkingService</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">initialize</span>

    <span class="vi">@client</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">drink_a_beer</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre>

<p>And you know what, that's already our minimum viable product! We have
a client who can drink a beer, lovely! After we show it to potential clients
they may not want to drink just some random beer. Maybe they want to select
their favorite Scenario first:</p>

<pre><code class="language-gherkin"><span class="k">Feature:</span><span class="nf"> Drining beer</span>

<span class="nf">    </span><span class="k">Then </span><span class="nf">I want to drink the beer I choose</span></code></pre>

<p>The tests may looks like this:</p>

<p>Going further, now we may want to know how drunk the guy is. Maybe we
don't want to sell him a beer when he looks like a sack of potatoes.

<span class="k">end</span></code></pre>

<p>Two new things shown up around the code: the first is validation, thus this
dumb example is enough to return false if someone can't drink the
beer. Otherwise we can consider returning some errors hash. In fact,
validations are very hard problem itself. There's a holy war about where
do validations should belong to, should they belong to the model like in
ActiveRecord? But this requires dealing with various contexts very often.
To the service, or form? Well, this may cause unncecessery repetition,
and we don't want to repeat ourselves. Or maybe validators should be totally separated
objects, service-like callables for checking various requirements on
the passed objects? I personally think that what belongs to model,
should be there, what belongs to service/form should be there. No
mixing contexts, there's nothing worse than dealing with extra states.
I think validations itself is a good topic for a future blog post,
stay tuned for it.</p>

<p>The second new thing is <code>ClientsRepository</code>, what's that? This is our
proxy to data storage. <strong>Some, undefined data storage</strong>. You shouldn't
imagine storage as a database. Storage is just a detail. It may be a
simple Ruby hash. Speaking shortly, <strong>It doesn't mather at all</strong>.
Here's how our clients repository may look like:</p>

<p>Now I can imagine a bunch of people saying, <em>Ohh, but how can I retrieve a list
of all the clients</em>? Let me answer you with a question: Does your domain
model require that feature?</p>

<p>Second thing, you see that <code>ClientsRepository</code> inherits from a mock repository
implementation. That's how it works, the repository is just a plugin, when
you decide that you need to have your data persisted, you can just switch
it to MySQL, Redis or whatever other driver you like. You can use global
variable as well, use whatever is cleaner for you:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby"><span class="vg">$clients_repository</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">ClientsMockRepository</span></code></pre>

<p>We can go further and further, checking if the beer is available, charging
the client for his drink, etc. etc. You can play with it at your home -
yeah, treat it as a homework - you will see by yourself how easy is
to implement a new features, changing existing ones and move project forward
when you simply don't care about the details - storage, delivery method,
views, etc.</p>

<p>Oh, let me tell ya, <strong>the tests are blazingly fast</strong> no matter if you're
using RSpec, Cucumber or God knows what other inventention. But, what's way
more important for your clients, it to test what they actually do want to
test. It doesn't test GUI or other shit which <strong>doesn't matter</strong> at the
moment.</p>

<p>As I said, after a while, when you may need a database, you can simply
write a driver for it, a plugin, because <strong>a database is nothing more
than a plugin</strong>... The same happens with visual representations, we can
wrap our interaction around with some boundaries, write some presenter
for it, write bunch of Rails spaghetti. We can expose it as a webservice
and present using only JavaScript. There's no limits, can you see it now?
<strong>You should always keep as much doors open as possible. Good architectural
decisions allows you to keep doors open</strong>, use it wisely.</p>

<h3 id="Optimize...+pivot?">Optimize... pivot?</h3>

<p>Well, that's all for today. Some of you guys may consider this article
as a pivot against your mindset, for some it may be just optimization,
for many others it may be total bullshit. I will be happy to meet
all of you and listen to your constructive feedback. Maybe your
feedback will cause a pivot in my mindset? For sure it will optimize
it!</p>

<p>At the end, I would like to also thank Cubox for how they helped me to
change my mindset during last year. Thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/apotonick">apotonick</a>
again! Big thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/saturnflyer">Jim Gay</a> for his
great talk at wroc_love.rb about DCI - even if I don't agree with all the
presented ideas it helped me a lot to clarify mine :P. Also, thanks
to <a href="https://twitter.com/tlossen">Tim Lossen</a> for raising the glove
in the battle between monolythic apps versus web-services I go for,
which caused me to dig deeper and deeper about this topic. I can't wait to see
your talk at EuRuKo! And of course thanks to <a href="http://anarchogeek.com">rabble</a>
for infecting me with Lean Startup stuff and making me understand it
in practice.</p>

<p>Like always thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/poteland">pote</a> for reviewing
my ugly english.</p>
